# Beckham APN Mods

**A module that can be used on stock or custom roms which have Magisk Manager installed**

### What does this module do?

It replaces the apns-conf.xml from `/system/etc` with the one in this module.

### Why do I need this?

Maybe you do, maybe you don't... The apns-conf.xml in this module is from beckham's PPWS29.183-29-2-3 firmware and 
I've have edited it to remove the visibilty restrictions and allowed all apn's to be user editable.
